# My-Project-Sentimental analysis of social media
Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are used by people to express their opinions and emotions.
These posts can be about products, politics, movies, or current events.
Sentiment Analysis helps us understand whether a message is positive, negative, or neutral.
The project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text data.
Real-time data is collected from platforms like Twitter using APIs.
The text is cleaned and processed before being analyzed by different algorithms.
Final results are shown using graphs, charts.
This helps businesses and researchers understand public opinion and make informed decisions.

In this project, we aim to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data collected from Kaggle 
The goal is to predict the data of tweets and classify them into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. 
We will preprocess the text data by cleaning, removing noise data (such as emojis and shortcut's)etc.
Using machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, along with NLP tools.
We will build a sentiment classifier.The results will be visualized using plots to help understand public sentiment trends, and can be applied to various real-world areas such as public opinion and customer feedback.
